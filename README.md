# SecretCord

[SecretCord](https://sc.nirewen.dev) is a way to have a Discord Secret Santa

> Create a room and ask your friends to join
>
> Add notes and rules to the game
>
> Then, close the room so no one can join anymore
>
> And have the website pick an entry automatically

- The entry is picked on demand, meaning it's only picked when the button is pressed

- The pick is completely random, the only check is for the current user

- No one can see your notes except the user who picked your entry
